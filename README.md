## Design Guidelines

### FDM Design Guidelines

| Parameter | Minimum Value | Recommended Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Wall Thickness (vertical)** | 0.8 mm | 1.2 mm+ | 2+ perimeters at 0.4 mm nozzle |
| **Wall Thickness (horizontal/top)** | 0.8 mm | 1.0–1.2 mm+ | 4–6 top/bottom layers minimum |
| **Wall Thickness (unsupported/tall)** | 1.0 mm | 1.5 mm+ | Increases with height-to-thickness ratio |
| **Wall Thickness (structural/load-bearing)** | 1.5 mm | 2.0–3.0 mm+ | 3+ perimeters; 20%+ infill |
| **Tolerance (features < 100 mm)** | ±0.3 mm | ±0.2 mm (tuned) | Depends on printer; affected by thermal contraction, belt tension, steps/mm |
| **Tolerance (features > 100 mm)** | ±0.3% | ±0.2% (tuned) | Scale-dependent; thermal contraction affects larger parts |
| **Clearance (moving parts)** | 0.5 mm | 0.6–0.8 mm | Gap between moving parts to prevent fusion |
| **Press Fit** | +0.1 mm interference | +0.15–0.2 mm interference | Interference fit; test fit required |
| **Snap Fit** | +0.2 mm clearance | +0.25–0.3 mm clearance | Temporary deformation for assembly |
| **Overhang (without support)** | 45° from vertical | ≤45° from vertical | >45° may require supports; surface quality degrades |
| **Overhang (with support)** | Up to 60° | ≤50° | >60° even with supports risks heat buildup and poor surface |
| **Bridging (reliable)** | 10 mm | ≤10 mm | Minimal sag with proper cooling and tension |
| **Bridging (possible, some droop)** | 10–30 mm | — | First-layer drooping expected; may need support |
| **Bridging (> 30 mm)** | — | Add center column or support | Unsupported spans >30 mm likely to fail |
| **Hole Diameter (vertical)** | 1.0 mm | ≥2.0 mm | Smaller holes may not print; bell-shaped deformation |
| **Hole Diameter (horizontal)** | 2.0 mm | ≥3.0 mm | Horizontal holes need teardrop shape to avoid supports |
| **Hole Compensation** | +0.2 mm | +0.2–0.4 mm over nominal | Holes print smaller than designed; compensate in CAD |
| **Minimum Feature Size** | 0.4 mm (nozzle diameter) | 0.8–1.0 mm | Related to nozzle size; 0.2 mm layer height common |
| **Thread Size (minimum)** | M3 | M4+ | Tapped threads: M3 minimum; printed threads: M5+ recommended |
| **Infill (decorative)** | 5–10% | 10–15% | Gyroid or grid patterns for balanced strength |
| **Infill (functional)** | 20% | 20–50% | Gyroid, honeycomb, or cubic for isotropic strength |
| **Infill (structural)** | 40% | 50–100% | Solid for maximum strength; 3+ perimeters |

### SLA/DLP Design Guidelines

| Parameter | Minimum Value | Recommended Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Wall Thickness (unsupported)** | 0.4 mm | 0.6 mm+ | Thin walls may break during support removal |
| **Wall Thickness (supported)** | 0.3 mm | 0.4 mm+ | Connected to other geometry for stability |
| **Tolerance** | ±0.1 mm | ±0.15 mm | Higher accuracy than FDM; resin shrinkage ~0.3% |
| **Minimum Detail Size** | 0.1–0.2 mm | 0.3–0.5 mm | Depends on XY resolution (25–50 μm typical) |
| **Overhang** | 30° from vertical | ≤30° from vertical | Shallower overhangs reduce support marks |
| **Hole Diameter** | 0.5 mm | ≥1.0 mm | Small holes may clog with uncured resin |
| **Drain Holes (hollow parts)** | 3–5 mm | 5–8 mm+ | Allows resin drainage; 2+ holes recommended |
| **Support Spacing** | 0.5–1.0 mm from surface | 0.5 mm offset | Supports leave marks; offset from critical surfaces |

### SLS Design Guidelines

| Parameter | Minimum Value | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Wall Thickness** | 0.7–1.0 mm | Unfused powder supports geometry; no separate supports needed |
| **Tolerance** | ±0.2 mm | Depends on material and machine; nylon shrinks ~3% |
| **Clearance (moving parts)** | 0.5–1.0 mm | Interlocking parts can be printed assembled |
| **Hole Diameter** | 1.0 mm | Unfused powder must be removable |
| **Escape Holes (hollow parts)** | 5 mm+ | Required for powder removal |

### General Design Best Practices

- **Orient parts strategically**: Strongest in X/Y plane; weakest in Z (layer adhesion ~60% of bulk strength for FDM)
- **Minimize support usage**: Design self-supporting angles (<45° for FDM); use teardrop holes for horizontal channels
- **Add fillets and chamfers**: Reduces stress concentration; improves printability at edges
- **Design for assembly**: Split large parts; use alignment pins, screw bosses, snap fits
- **Account for anisotropy**: FDM parts are weaker along layer lines; orient load-bearing features perpendicular to layers
- **Test fit before full print**: Print small-scale or single-feature tests to validate dimensions
- **Use standard hardware**: Design for M3, M4, M5 screws and heat-set inserts where possible
- **Consider shrinkage**: PLA ~0.2%, ABS ~0.5–0.7%, Nylon ~1.5%; compensate in design or slicer scaling
